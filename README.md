# File Organizer [Windows]
Moves all files in subfolders of current directory to current directory.

# What is it about?
If you have a lot of folders with only few files contained in them and maybe a lot of them are just empty, just run this and you will get all your files in one place. Now you can safely delete all your your folders without worrying about losing data. It checks all the subfolders present in your current directory and any subfolders within them and moves all files present in them to current folder.

# WARNING!
This process is irreversible. Don't blame me if you mistakenly destroyed your file system. NEVER RUN IN ROOT DIRECTORY OF YOUR SYSTEM.

# Usage
Place the .bat file in the folder whose subfolders need to be cleaned and run it.
